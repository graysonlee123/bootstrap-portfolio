                        <p>My name is Grayson Gantek, and I am a designer, developer, and illustrator. I grew up in and
                            around Acworth, Georgia (just outside of Atlanta) and am currently working through the
                            Georgia
                            Tech Coding Boot Camp to earn a certificate in full-stack web development. I've always been
                            a
                            creator for as long as I can remember.</p>
                        <p>My story is very similar to other kids from the 90s: Cartoon Network with Toaster Strudel
                            mornings, Gamecube gaming, Heelies, airsoft with best friends in the summers, and most
                            importantly, LEGOs. They taught me how to follow instructions and how to be imaginative, but
                            most importantly, they taught me how to create. These early interests directly influenced
                            the
                            way I carry myself in my personal life and in my professional life.</p>
                        <p>Currently I am transferring universities from Kennesaw State University to Georgia Tech.
                            There I
                            plan to study web development and gain a certificate from Georgia Tech.</p>
                        <p>I started working at a local print shop in the summer of 2016. My initial role there was lead
                            graphic designer, but during my time there I was taught so much more. I got the opportunity
                            to
                            learn about print design, preparation, and how to work with customers to help figure out
                            what
                            they envisioned their projects to be.</p>
